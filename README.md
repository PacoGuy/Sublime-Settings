Sublime-Settings
================

A modified preference file for sublime.

Modified code changes the User Preferences to:
- Monokai theme
- Phases the caret in a pulsing manner
- Makes folders in Side Bar bold
- Keeps code folding arrows visible
- Sets font size to 20
- Highlights the line the caret is presently in
- Sets top and bottom line padding for better readability
- Word Wrap is on by default <!-- EXPERIMENTAL Let me know if this causes issues -->
- See below for additonal settings, need to add info on each setting

The `Preferences.sublime-settings` file code can replace with no modification into the (Sublime: Preferences: Settings - User) file

Note- File created on Linux Sublime Text 3, needs to be tested on other environments

Note- Method to have preferences file automatically modified would be nice
